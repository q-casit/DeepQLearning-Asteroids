# DeepQLearning-Asteroids
Light Deep Q Network Learning in Asteroids game

This is code for Asteroids game (which is a typical vector game) with Deep Q Network Algorithm , a little bit more complexity than FlappyBird. 

The game has 5 action inputs, adopt the basic Deep Q network algorithm from DeepLearningFlappyBird, but rewrite the network layers, reshape sample input size, batch cache, reward with more action states, etc.

Dependencies:

Python 2.7 or 3,TensorFlow,pygame,OpenCV-Python

How to run:

python main.py
